Welcome to Mafia. 

How to play:
1. Choose how many players are playing and assign each person a player number
2. Dont reveal your role or let people know what your role is. (There are 3 roles, Townsperson, Mafia and Jester)
3. Talk with other players to try and figure out who the mafia is
4. Vote out players based on your suspicion.

The Mafia wins if there is more mafia than townspeople, likewise the townspeople win if they vote out all the Mafia.
The jester wins if they get voted out.
